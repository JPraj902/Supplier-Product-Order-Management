## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your system.
1. **Locate the SQL File**:
   - The SQLite database file is usually named `database.sqlite` (or similar) and should already be included in the project.
2. **Database Schema**:
   - If you need to initialize a fresh database, use the provided schema.sql file to create the necessary tables:
```
   CREATE TABLE suppliers (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    contact_info TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    supplier_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (supplier_id) REFERENCES suppliers (id)
);
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    product_id INTEGER,
    quantity INTEGER,
    order_date TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products (id)
);
```
- You can execute this script using any SQLite management tool or programmatically within the application.
3. **Connect to SQLite**:
- Ensure your application is configured to use the correct path to the SQLite database file (e.g., `database.sqlite` in the root directory).
